# Fitness Tracker Web App

A web application built with **Django** to centrally and efficiently track your workout progress, body weight, caloric intake, and body measurements.

## Key Features

1. **Exercise Tracking with GIFs**

   - Embed custom GIFs generated from YouTube to illustrate each movement.
   - Lazy loading and file optimization for fast performance.

2. **Automated Weight Progression**

   - Smart load-increase suggestions based on completed reps and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion).

3. **Body Weight Logging**

   - Record daily or monthly weight and visualize trends with line charts.

4. **Calorie Intake Tracking**

   - Integration options:
     - Python scraping via the `myfitnesspal` library.
     - Manual CSV upload exported from MyFitnessPal and processing with pandas.
     - Nutritionix API (free tier available).

5. **Effort Survey (RPE)**

   - Prompt for perceived exertion (1â€“10 scale) after each set to fine-tune recommendations.

6. **Monthly Body Measurements**

   - Form to submit measurements (chest, waist, hips, arms, legs).
   - Evolution charts and alerts for significant changes.
